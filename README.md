### Astro

Decided to give Astro a try after attending a talk at Xebia Amsterdam. Astro ofcourse profiles itself as very minimalistic and fast, together with the idea of using only what you need for your project, I had a go at it. Most of it is plain HTML and CSS/Tailwind with the added bonus of modules and components. I really enjoyed working with it and learning something new. 

### Svelte

For the small bits of reactive/javascript I wanted to work with svelte, it has caught my attention some time ago and I will definatly be doing more with this framework in the future. It has a similar structure as Vue uses in a way (script, template and css in one file) and also aims to be really fast.

### End result 

A pretty decent V1.0 that runs extremely fast, responsive for mobile and desktop. Now to add more projects and eventually overhaul the entire site as I progress and learn!
